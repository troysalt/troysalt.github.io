### Install QGIS on a Chromebook
As Chromebooks become more powerful devices, they're becoming more capable of running intensive applications. With Linux (beta), the doors are open to many open-source programs. A couple of years ago, I never thought I would be running GIS analysis on my Chromebook, but here we are today.

### Prerequisites

- Linux (beta) needs to be installed on your Chromebook. This is a relatively straight-forward process, for instructions, see [this Google support page](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en).
- I would recommend at least a Core m3 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage. *However, you can install QGIS on lesser machines, but the you'll likely have issues with large data sets*. I've installed QGIS on both a Pixel Slate (m3 7th gen, 8 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage) and an HP X2 (m3 8th gen, 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage).
- Either know the Linux terminal, or be ready to learn something completely new. You can always change your mind on Linux by uninstalling Linux through the settings.
