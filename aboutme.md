title: About me
---

Troy is a research associate at the Pacific Northwest National Lab on the Geospatial Science, Analytics, and Geointelligence Team. His work focuses on geographic information science and remote sensing, often involving geospatial big data like highly detailed multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, LiDAR data, and national-scale datasets. Recent examples include analysis of historical fire weather data, spaceborne mapping of fire retardant drops using machine learning, land screening for suitable algae biofuel sites, vegetation characterization using drone-collected RGB imagery and LiDAR data, and species-level vegetation mapping with hyperspectral data.

Troy graduated from the University of Utah with an MS in geography in 2021, where he studied the relationship between spatial resolution of drone-acquired imagery and classification accuracy of semantic segmentation-based convolutional neural networks. He also holds a BS in environmental science, which he obtained from the University of Delaware in 2019, leading to his broad experience in several environmental disciplines like climatology, soil science, geology, and hydrology. Troy is passionate about integrating the latest data analysis methods into the geospatial realm to help solve complex environmental problems.
