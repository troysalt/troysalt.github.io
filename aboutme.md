title: About me
---

I am a master's student in Geography at the University of Utah, where I am part of the Utah Remote Sensing Applications (URSA) and Digitally Integrated Geographic Information Technologies (DIGIT) labs. For my thesis research, I have developed a deep learning neural network to classify *Phragmites australis* and other land cover in the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area in Davis County, Utah. I am currently working on part 2 of my research, simulating different resolution imagery and classifying with deep learning to compare results at different resolutions. This research will inform the Utah Deparment of Natural Resources for planning of future monitoring and restoration efforts at Utah's wetland ecosystems.
