title: About me
---

I am a master's student in Geography at the University of Utah, where I am part of the Utah Remote Sensing Applications (URSA) and Digitally Integrated Geographic Information Technologies (DIGIT) labs. For my thesis research, I am developing deep learning neural networks for complex classification tasks with fine-resolution multispectral imagery.
