Troy is a research associate at the Pacific Northwest National Lab on the Geospatial Science, Analytics, and Geointelligence Team. His work focuses on environmental remote sensing and GIS applications, including vegetation image classification, object detection from remotely sensed imagery, and natural disaster response and planning. Troy graduated from the University of Utah with an MS in Geography, emphasizing remote sensing in 2021. His thesis involved the classification of the invasive plant, Phragmites australis, in the Great Salt Lake ecosystem with fine resolution UAS-acquired imagery and convolutional neural networks. Troy also has an interdisciplinary background in environmental science from his undergraduate in environmental science (BS) at the University of Delaware and other work experience. This includes geology, soil science, hydrology, and biological monitoring. Outside of work, Troy enjoys exploring the great outdoors.
