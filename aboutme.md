title: About me

I am a master's student in Geography at the University of Utah, where I am part of the Utah Remote Sensing Applications (URSA) and Digitally Integrated Geographic Information Technologies (DIGIT) labs. For my thesis research, I am utilizing several methods to classify the invasive *Phragmites australis* in the Great Salt Lake using fine-resolution multipectral UAS imagery. A proper thesis question is to come.
