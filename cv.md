# Work Experience
---

**GIS Analyst & Graduate Assistant** - University of Utah  
Salt Lake City, UT | *Aug 2019 - Present*  
At the DIGIT GIS Lab, I produce deliverables for federal, state, and local government agencies, and private entities such as: the National Park Service, Collins Aerospace, and the Utah DNR. My work includes image classification, data mining, QA/QC, data management, and more.

**Digital Marketing** - Avkin  
New Castle, DE | *Mar 2016 - Present*  
I focus on updating the website, digital advertising, partnerships with outside consultants, and evaluating marketing campaigns. I routinely create visual reports and communicate with the executive board.

**Geomorphic Roads Analysis and Inventory Package Intern** - US Forest Service (via Aerotek)  
Glide, OR | *Jun 2019 - Aug 2019*  
Collected hydrological data to track erosion and sediment transport on Forest Service roads. The data is processed through an ArcGIS model to analyze surface erosion, gully, landslide, and stream crossing failure risk, and track sediment inputs to streams. The data will be used for decision making to improve water quality and road surface conditions in the Umpqua National Forest.

**GIS Intern** - University of Delaware, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences  
Newark, DE | *Oct 2018 - May 2019*  
Created a GIS to catalogue the edible plants on campus in addition to the new food forest garden. The system uses ArcGIS Online for simple integration with the University’s web presence, and data will be collected with Collector for ArcGIS. A schema ensures data are entered properly, even for those with little to no GIS experience. 

**Undergraduate Researcher** - North Carolina State University  
Raleigh, NC | *Jun 2018 - Aug 2018*  
Studied methods of assessing soil water infiltration using sprinkle, single-ring, and double-ring infiltrometers. The objective was to determine whether more practical devices (i.e. small diameter single-ring) are accurate enough for soil assessment, especially for agriculture. The program, the Basic Environmental Soil Science Training (BESST), is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I was advised by Dr. Josh Heitman and Dr. Aziz Amoozegar of NC State University. The research was presented at the Soil Science Society of America Meeting in January 2019, and we are working on writing a paper to *Agriculture & Environmental Letters*.

**GIS Consultant** - Mission Street Parks Conservancy  
Salem, OR | *Feb 2018 - Mar 2018*  
Developed a GIS database for plants at Bush’s Pasture Park in Salem, OR. The project was completed using ArcGIS and published to ArcGIS Online, viewable at missionstreetparks.org/locations-map/.

**eIntern** - US Department of State, Humanitarian Information Unit (HUI), MapGive Initiative  
Remote | *Sept 2017 - Dec 2017*  
Contributed to open geographic data with OpenStreetMap and organized volunteer events called ‘Mapathons’ to help humanitarian aid response. I continue to host Mapathons and have trained over 100 volunteers.

**Research Assistant** - Delaware Department of Natural Resources (DNREC), Mosquito Control Section  
Glasgow, DE | *May 2017 - Sep 2017*  
Conducted a study on Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus which are vectors of the Zika virus. Maintained and collected from 8 field sites, identified ~20,000 mosquitoes, and produced a publication in the *Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association*.

**Biological Aide** - Delaware Department of Natural Resources (DNREC), Mosquito Control Section  
Glasgow, DE | *May 2016 - Oct 2016*  
I performed routine mosquito breeding surveillance and abatement activities (majority of time); collected West Nile and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus surveillance data; trapped for mosquitoes to later identify by genus and species; used handheld GPS and tablets for field data collections/record keeping; addressed citizen mosquito complaints; and conducted public education efforts on how communities and citizens can reduce mosquito breeding in and around their homes plus protect themselves from mosquito borne diseases.

# Teaching Experience
---

**Teaching Assistant** - University of Delaware, English Language Institute  
Newark, DE | *Jan 2019 - Apr 2019*  
I was a teaching assistant for the Geological Hazards Lab Section (GEOL115). The course is taught through the English Language Institute's (ELI) Academic Transitions program which consists of international students conditionally admitted as undergrads to the University of Delaware. I was responsible for instruction and grading of 12 lab sessions. 

**Peer Mentor** - University of Delaware, First Year Seminar  
Newark, DE | *Aug 2018 - Dec 2018*  
I was the peer mentor for the University’s Introduction to the Environment (ENSC101) course. It was my responsibility to help freshman students transition to college life on campus. I taught 12 class periods including academic skills, goal setting, safety and wellness, university resources, ethics, and more.
